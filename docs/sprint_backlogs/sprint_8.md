# Sprint 8
## M-13: Make port choice flexible
As of now, the applications port is hardcoded which makes it fragile when distributing among different users and systems. Make the application automatically select a free port.

## M-12: Initiate QA

## M-10: Build application for Linux and open for distribution
Build and publish on outpostmessenger.com

## M-11: Create installation script
Users need to conveniently download and install the application. Create a bash script that handles it for them.

Actual time: 10 hours


## CF-15: Implement loading bar on startup
Sometimes the loading of a client's information can take a while on startup. Ensure the application will show a loading spinner when loading it, and if there's  an error, try again ad infinitum.
